[pid=chapo]Two weeks ago I spent some time implementing Wadler's
"Prettier Printer". The implementation is fairly straightforward
except for three functions that are not seen as terminating. Here
are the three tricks that made them go through.[/p]

[p]Wadler's paper introduces a [span=inline-code]Doc[/span] datatype
abstractly representing documents in terms of raw strings, indentation,
newlines, concatenation but also alternatives of subdocuments. Semantically,
alternatives are used to offer two different layouts of the same underlying
content. Various functions manipulate these documents; they may introduce
alternatives when it's too early to make a decision or get rid of them e.g.
once the maximum width of the final document is known.[/p]

[h3]Using Vec rather than List[/h]

[p]The first problem shows up with the [span=inline-code]fill[/span]
function which turns a list of documents into a document by trying to
fill the lines as much as possible. If the list is less than one
element long, the strategy to adopt is evident. In case it's longer,
the algorithm calls [span=inline-code]flatten[/span] to collapse
documents onto one line and offers two alternatives: the one where
they have been made to fit and another one where a newline has
been inserted.[/p]

[p=code]fill :: [Doc] -> Doc
...
fill (x:y:zs) = (flatten x <+> fill (flatten y : zs))
                :<|>
                (x &lt;/&gt; fill (y : zs))
[/p]

[p]The issue here is that [span=inline-code]flatten y : zs[/span] is
not a subterm of [span=inline-code]x:y:zs[/span] which makes the
recursive call to [span=inline-code]fill[/span] look illegal. The
right notion of smaller here is not "strict subterm" but rather
"smaller length". This can be fixed by simply changing the type of
the function to [span=inline-code]∀ {n} → Vec Doc n → Doc[/span] thus
making the termination obviously structural: if the length of
[span=inline-code]x:y:zs[/span] is [span=inline-code]suc (suc n)[/span]
then the length of [span=inline-code]flatten y : zs[/span] is
[span=inline-code]suc n[/span], a strict subterm![/p]

[p]The code is kept the same but the type has an extra invariant
built in (which is threaded via implicit arguments) and that makes
the termination checker happy. We can recover a top-level function
with [span=inline-code]fill[/span]'s type by pre-composing our
replacement for it with [span=inline-code]Data.Vec.fromList[/span].[/p]

[h3]CPS-transform algorithms using queues to store future work[/h]

[p]In Wadler's paper, a function [span=inline-code]best[/span] is in
charge of picking the most tightly-packed display form of a document
a certain width can handle. It calls an auxiliary function
[span=inline-code]be[/span] which takes as arguments the width, the
number of characters already inserted on the current line and a LIFO
of documents (together with their respective indentation levels) that
still have to be displayed.[/p]

[p]During a typical run of the function, sub-structures get pushed
on the stack and later on recursive calls are performed on them.
However when that happens, we have lost the connection with the
super-structure justifying that the call is indeed on a smaller
argument and thus valid. Here is part of the code demonstrating
the issue:[/p]

[p=code]be :: Int -> Int -> [(Int, Doc)] -> Doc
...
be w k ((i,NIL):z)     = be w k z
be w k ((i,x :<> y):z) = be w k ((i,x):(i,y):z)
...
[/p]

[p]The trick here is to perform the recursive calls when the
evidence justifying them is available but to only use their
results later on. In other word: replace future arguments
with the continuation associated to them. This forces us to
slightly change the type of the function: rather than working
with a stack of [span=inline-code](Int, Doc)[/span] and
inspecting its head, we work with a focused
[span=inline-code]Int[/span] and [span=inline-code]Doc[/span]
and a continuation [span=inline-code]Int -> Doc[/span] which,
provided a number of characters already inserted on the current
line will yield the document corresponding to the rest of the
computation. The two lines we saw earlier on have now become
[footnote]Here we are actually using [span=inline-code]ℕ[/span]
rather than [span=inline-code]Int[/span] because these values
are always positive anyways so we might as well say so in the
type![/footnote]:[/p]

[p=code]be : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → Doc → (ℕ → Doc) → Doc
...
be w k i NIL       ds = ds k
be w k i (d :<> e) ds = be w k i d $ λ k → be w k i e ds
...
[/p]

[p]For [url=https://github.com/gallais/potpourri/blob/master/agda/poc/CPS-Termination.agda]
a more self-contained example[/url], I have implemented a binary
tree traversal using the same trick to assemble a list of all its
leaves. The resulting algorithm corresponds to using a difference
list to collect all the leaves.[/p]

[h3]Use sized-types to make higher-order functions usable[/h]

[p]Last but not least, one of the examples of Wadler's library
in action is the definition of a pretty printer for a deep
embedding of XML. The XML trees are represented by:[/p]

[p=code]data XML = Elt String [Att] [XML]
         | Txt String
data Att = Att String String[/p]

[p]The function [span=inline-code]showXMLs[/span] is used to neatly
display the tree. In one of its clauses, it perform recursive calls
on the subtrees via a higher-order function [span=inline-code]showFill[/span]
which Agda has issues seeing as terminating:[/p]

[p=code]showFill :: (a -> [Doc]) -> [a] -> Doc
showFill f [] = nil
showFill f xs = bracket "" (fill (concat (map f xs))) ""

showXMLs :: XML -> [Doc]
...
showXMLs (Elt n a c)  = [text "<" <> showTag n a <> text ">" <>
                        showFill showXMLs c <>
                        text "&lt;/" <> text n <> text ">"]
...[/p]

[p]A common trick in this type of situation is to mutually define
[span=inline-code]showXMLs[/span] and an inlined version of the
partially applied function [span=inline-code]showFill showXMLs[/span].
However this code duplication is rather annoying.
It turns out that we can, just like in our first example, save the day
by slightly changing the types of the structures and functions at hand.
This time we'll add implicit [span=inline-code]Size[/span] information
[footnote]For more on sized and dependent types, cf. Andreas Abel's
[url=http://www2.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/~abel/par10.pdf]MiniAgda: Integrating
Sized and Dependent Types[/url][/footnote] to the definition of
[span=inline-code]XML[/span] and [span=inline-code]showXMLs[/span].
[/p]

[p=code]data XML : {i : Size} → Set where
  Elt : ∀ {i} → String → List Attribute → List (XML {i}) → XML {↑ i}
  Txt : ∀ {i} → String → XML {i}

showXMLs : ∀ {i} → XML {i} → List Doc
...
[/p]

[p]When we don't explicitly specify the [span=inline-code]Size[/span],
it gets defaulted to infinity which means that by default the indexed
type will behave like its non-indexed counterpart. However we can get
the full benefit of sized types whenever we do mention the index.[/p]

[p]By making explicit reference to the tree's size in the type of
[span=inline-code]showXMLs[/span], we get the termination checker
to accept its definition as valid. Indeed, when matching on the
constructor [span=inline-code]Elt[/span], the implicit size argument
is [span=inline-code]↑ i[/span] for some [span=inline-code]i[/span]
(cf. [span=inline-code]Elt[/span]'s return type) and in the recursive
occurence passed to [span=inline-code]showFill[/span], it has become
[span=inline-code]i[/span] which is strictly smaller.[/p]


[h3]Conclusion[/h]

[p]What I assumed to be a simple matter of closely following
Wadler's paper turned out to be a nice exercise in convincing
the termination checker whilst staying true to the original
algorithm. In each one of these three examples we have managed
to avoid both the sledgehammer that is
[url=http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/bove-reloaded/]well-founded
recursion[/url] and code duplication by using either type-level
tricks or a [url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=178053]CPS
transformation[/url].
