<p id="chapo">In the paper
<a href="http://www.citeulike.org/user/gallais/article/1244296">
<i>Representing Cyclic Structures as Nested Datatypes</i></a>,
the authors dismiss quite quickly the idea of encoding cyclic lists
by using a function space to represent the loop in favour of
(type-level) de Bruijn levels. I wanted to see how far one can go
with the more extensional approach whilst retaining good properties
(canonical forms, productivity, etc.). It turns out that the answer
is: "quite far, really".</p>



<p>The setup is pretty simple: we want to represent cyclic lists in
a purely functional language. A naïve solution would be to turn to
codata and use streams built using a fixpoint in Haskell. However,
representing the cycle with a material artefact will allow us to
analyze it (is it finite?), display it as a string by writing the
fixpoint down explicitly, make serialization trivial or transform
it by mapping a function, permuting the elements, or adding /
removing some of them from the cycle.</p>



<a name="FegarasAndSheard'sSolution"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#FegarasAndSheard'sSolution">#</a> Fegaras and Sheard's solution</h3>



<p>Cyclic lists are represented using a mixed-variant datatype. On
top of the expected <span class="inline-code">CNil</span> and <span class="inline-code">Cons</span> shared with usual
lists, a <span class="inline-code">CRec</span> constructor is provided. It declares a pointer
which may be used later on to represent that very node. It should be
noted that <span class="inline-code">CRec</span> is <span class="inline-code">Cons</span>-like in order to guarantee
that all cycles are productive.</p>



<p class="code">data CList a = CNil
             | Cons a (CList a)
             | CRec a (CList a -> CList a)</p>



<p>This definition exploits the function space of the host language
to handle the pointer declaration in a sort of Higher Order
Abstract Syntax fashion. It makes giving a semantics for it in terms
of streams quite easy: one just needs to feed the function stored in
<span class="inline-code">CRec</span> with the list itself.</p>



<p class="code">toStream :: CList a -> [a]
toStream CNil          = []
toStream (Cons x xs)   = x : toStream xs
toStream xs@(CRec x r) = x : toStream (r xs)</p>



<a name="TheLimitationsOfThisRepresentation"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#TheLimitationsOfThisRepresentation">#</a> The limitations of this representation</h3>



<p>Now, this representation has multiple problems. They are pointed
out in Ghani et al. to justify their favouring of a more intensional
approach to cycle representation. Most of them relate to the fact
that it does not put enough restrictions on the ways one may use
the variable provided by the <span class="inline-code">CRec</span> constructor. As a
consequence, the encoding lacks canonicity.</p>



<a name="ThereIsNoGuaranteeOnTheWayPointersAreUsed(ifAtAll)"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#ThereIsNoGuaranteeOnTheWayPointersAreUsed(ifAtAll)">#</a> There is no guarantee on the way pointers are used (if at all)</h3>



<p>Given that the cycle is represented using a function space, it
is hard to detect whether the variable has been used at all, or if
it has been used whether it was in a proper way or not. So far
nothing prevents a list from pretending to be cyclic by introducing
a pointer it will never use:</p>



<p class="code">finite = Cons 1 $ CRec 2 $ const CNil</p>



<p>Or introduce multiple pointers only one of which is meant to be
declared whilst the other ones are <span class="inline-code">CRec</span> cells misused as
<span class="inline-code">Cons</span> ones. This leads to the possibility of different
representations of the same object:</p>



<p class="code">fourTwos = Cons 4 $ CRec 2 id
arghTwos = CRec 4 $ const $ CRec 2 id</p>



<p>Last but not least, these lists can also fail at being cyclic
because a list transformer has been used improperly in the body
of the cycle without being rejected by the typechecker:</p>



<p class="code">nats = CRec 0 $ cmap (+1)</p>



<a name="UsefulFunctionsCannotBeWrittenWithoutUnfoldingTheCycle"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#UsefulFunctionsCannotBeWrittenWithoutUnfoldingTheCycle">#</a> Useful functions cannot be written without unfolding the
cycle</h3>



<p>But there is more! Even if one is willing to excuse these
imperfections, it is hard to define basic functions without
unwinding the cycle. It is for instance impossible to map a
function across a list without unfoding it. Indeed, using a
<span class="inline-code">CRec</span> constructor in the last case would provide us
with a <span class="inline-code">CList b</span> element but <span class="inline-code">r</span> expects a
<span class="inline-code">CList a</span> one.</p>



<p class="code">cmap :: (a -> b) -> CList a -> CList b
cmap f CNil          = CNil
cmap f (Cons x xs)   = Cons (f x) $ cmap f xs
<span class="bad">cmap f xs@(CRec x r) = Cons (f x) $ cmap f (r xs)</span></p>



<p>At that point, the picture we have drawn is pretty grim and we
can understand why one may want to ditch the extensional approach
altogether. But it turns out that there is a solution to all of our
problems: the type system!</p>



<a name="CallingTheTypeSystemToTheRescue."></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#CallingTheTypeSystemToTheRescue.">#</a> Calling the type system to the rescue.</h3>



<p>A few days before being confronted with this issue, I had read
the very interesting <a href="https://tel.github.io/2014/07/15/mutable_algorithms_in_immutable_languages_part_3/">account of the ST monad by Joseph Abrahamson</a>
explaining how the implementation used rank 2 polymorphism to avoid
references escaping their environment. It was only natural to recycle
that knowledge in our case to avoid all the API abuses evoked in the
previous section. The new <span class="inline-code">CList</span> type constructor takes two
arguments; the first one is the type of the elements it contains
whilst the second one is a phantom type used to enforce that the
constructor are only ever used in the way they were meant to.</p>



<p class="code">data CList a b where
  CNil :: CList a Closed
  Cons :: a -> CList a b -> CList a b
  CRec :: a -> (forall b. CList a b -> CList a b) -> CList a Closed</p>



<p><span class="inline-code">CRec</span>'s argument has to be polymorphic in the phantom
type which means that it may not use <span class="inline-code">CRec</span> or <span class="inline-code">CNil</span>
both of which fix the phantom type to <span class="inline-code">Closed</span>. In effect,
it has to be a finite number of <span class="inline-code">Cons</span> followed by the
variable provided. In other words, an element of type
<span class="inline-code">CList a Closed</span> describes precisely a potentially cyclic
list <a id="reftop1" href="#refbot1">[1]</a>. Hence the following type alias:</p>



<p class="code">data Closed = Closed
type List a = CList a Closed</p>



<p>All the broken examples are now rightfully rejected by the type
system which detects that we are trying to conflate types which are
incompatible when we declare a pointer but forget to use it, when we
declare multiple ones, etc. That is already a nice change but we
are still facing a major challenge: writing functions such as
<span class="inline-code">map</span> without unfolding the cycle. This is what Ghani et al.
write on that topic:</p>



<p class="quote"> "Although cycles are explicit in this representation,
almost all functions manipulating cyclic structures will need to
unwind the cycles (based on the intuition that Rec means fix). The
reason is that, although, we can recognize cycles as structures of
the form Rec f, the argument f is a function and we cannot analyze
functions well".</p>



<p>This was absolutely true in the situation they were facing. But
by exploiting the type system, we have managed to root out an
awful lot of unwanted constructs. To the point that we now know
for sure that there is <i>at most one</i> <span class="inline-code">CRec</span> constructor
in a <span class="inline-code">List a</span>. This implies in particular that we can detect
where the pointer declared by a <span class="inline-code">CRec</span> is used. Indeed, if
<span class="inline-code">xs</span> is equal to <span class="inline-code">CRec x f</span> then we know for sure that
<span class="inline-code">f xs</span> will contain a <span class="inline-code">CRec</span> and that it will be the
head constructor of <span class="inline-code">xs</span> showing up where the pointer was
used.</p>



<p>This means that we can actually build a <span class="inline-code">cfold</span> function
which will not unwind the cycle unless we want it to. Let's start
by writing down the most general type for it. The two first arguments
corresponds to the usual <span class="inline-code">Cons</span> and <span class="inline-code">CNil</span> cases with
the right phantom types sprinkled where necessary. The third one
is the one dealing with cycles and it mimics really closely the type
of <span class="inline-code">CRec</span>. The whole thing is implemented in terms of an
auxiliary function.</p>



<p class="code">cfold :: forall a (b :: * -> *).
         (forall ph. a -> b ph -> b ph) ->
         b Closed ->
         (a -> (forall ph. b ph -> b ph) -> b Closed) ->
         List a -> b Closed
cfold c n r = goCRec</p>



<p>This auxiliary function unfolds the list argument applying the
appropriate combinator to the constructor's arguments and the
the induction hypothesis. As its name <span class="inline-code">goCRec</span> suggests, it
traverses the <span class="inline-code">CRec</span> constructor before handing over the rest
of the work to <span class="inline-code">stopCRec</span>.</p>



<p class="code">goCRec :: forall ph. CList a ph -> b ph
goCRec CNil          = n
goCRec (Cons x xs)   = c x $ goCRec xs
goCRec xs@(CRec x p) = r x $ stopCRec (p xs)</p>



<p><span class="inline-code">stopCRec</span> is similarly structurally working its way
through the list except that it posesses an induction hypothesis
<span class="inline-code">ih</span> obtained earlier on by <span class="inline-code">goCRec</span>. When faced with
a <span class="inline-code">CRec</span>, we know for sure that we have just followed the
pointer back to where it was declared. As a consequence, we return
the induction hypothesis rather than unfolding the cycle yet
another time.</p>



<p class="code">stopCRec :: CList a Closed -> forall ph. b ph -> b ph
stopCRec (Cons x xs) ih = c x $ stopCRec xs ih
stopCRec (CRec _ _)  ih = ih</p>



<p>Now that we have this induction principle, it is really easy to
define a <span class="inline-code">cmap</span> which outputs a list with a structure
identical to the one we started with.</p>



<p class="code">cmap :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
cmap f = cfold (Cons . f) CNil (CRec . f)</p>



<p>And indeed, <span class="inline-code">cmap (+1) $ CRec 1 (Cons 2)</span> evaluates down to
<span class="inline-code">CRec 2 (Cons 3)</span> rather than the detestable
<span class="inline-code">Cons 2 (Cons 3 (Cons 2 (...)))</span> the naïve solution used to
produce.</p>



<p>It is also possible to instantiate this very generic scheme down
to ones with simpler types. One such instance is the induction
principle where the return type does not depend on the phantom
type:</p>



<p class="code">cfoldRec :: forall a b. (a -> b -> b) -> b ->
            (a -> (b -> b) -> b) -> List a -> b</p>



<p>An elegant use case of this <span class="inline-code">cfoldRec</span> is the definition
of the <span class="inline-code">Show</span> instance for <span class="inline-code">List a</span> which allows us
to display a finite string representing the cyclic structure in its
entirety. When we encounter the pointer declaration, we output
"rec X. " and keep showing the rest of the list but when the pointer
is used, we simply output "X" and stop.</p>



<p class="code">instance Show a => Show (List a) where
  show = cfoldRec (\ x -> (++) (show x ++ " : ")) "[]"
                  (\ x ih -> "rec X. " ++ show x ++ " : " ++ ih "X")</p>



<p>And, as we expected, <span class="inline-code">show $ CRec 1 (Cons 2)</span> now reduces
to the finite string <span class="inline-code">"rec X. 1 : 2 : X"</span>. It is also possible
to recover a <span class="inline-code">fold</span>-style function unwinding the cycle by
tying the knot in the third argument: the induction hypothesis
will just be the whole subcomputation itself!</p>



<p class="code">cfold' :: forall a b. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> List a -> b
cfold' c n = cfoldRec c n r
  where r :: a -> (b -> b) -> b
        <span class="bad">r a ih</span> = c a (ih $ <span class="bad">r a ih</span>)</p>



<p>This is precisely what we want to do when defining the semantics
of these cyclic lists in terms of streams. Hence the really concise
definition:</p>



<p class="code">toStream :: List a -> [ a ]
toStream = cfold' (:) []</p>



<p>There are still plenty of functions to implement on this
representation some of which may raise interesting questions:
<span class="inline-code">czip</span> will surely involve computing a least common
multiple. And it will enable us to define an <i>extensional</i>
equality on these cyclic structures. Exciting perspectives.</p>



<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#Conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h3>



<p>GADTs combined with higher rank polymorphism allowed us to bake
in invariants which were sufficient for us to write more useful
functions than the rather untyped approach led us to believe was
possible. The type of <span class="inline-code">cfold</span> lets us decide at any time
whether we want to unwind the cycle or not.</p>



<p>However, this approach is limited to cases in which it only
makes sense to have <i>one</i> cycle. This is not true anymore
when we consider datastructures which are not linear: a cyclic
tree may have different cycle in different branches, some of
which may be nested. It is then necessary to fall back to a
setup managing syntax with binding.</p>
