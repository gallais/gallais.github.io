<p id="chapo">Today I want to talk about something I came up with when
working on questions connected to the material presented in our
<a href="../pdf/icfp13.pdf">ICFP submission</a> but we did not get the
opportunity to discuss in the paper. The claim is that glueing
terms to the structure of a model allows the reader to get a good
intuition of the way the calculus works by making explicit what used
to be hidden <i>under the hood</i>.</p>



<p>I learned about the glueing technique whilst reading about
models of the simply-typed SK combinatorial calculus
<a id="reftop1" href="#refbot1">[1]</a>. Glueing is described as a tool to
circumvent the mismatch between the really restrictive structure of
SK terms and the rather liberal (naïve) model: if one is able to
evaluate SK terms in the model, it is however impossible to extract
normal forms from the semantical objects without applying some kind of lambda to SK encoding procedure! Glueing syntactical terms
to their semantical counterparts is precisely what is required by
the procedure to be able to reify partial applications of S and K.</p>



<p>Glueing resurfaced later on in my own experimentations when
defining a model for a weak-head normalization by evaluation
<a id="reftop2" href="#refbot2">[2]</a>.
Indeed, the need to be able to throw away unnecessary computations
(e.g. the argument part of a stuck application should not be
reduced) is easily met by enriching the model with syntactical
artefacts corresponding to <i>source terms</i> for the semantical
objects. A pleasant side-effet of the added structure is the
simplification of the formulation and proofs of correctness
properties in Type Theory.</p>



<a name="TheSetting"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#TheSetting">#</a> The setting</h3>



<p>But in this blog post I would like to argue that there is more
to it than merely solving these kind of problems: glueing can be
used to obtain a well-structured model highlighting some nice
properties of the calculus. The setting for this example is the
definition of a normalization function for the simply-typed lambda
calculus which does not require a glueing to be defined. Types are
either the base, uninterpreted, type or arrow types:</p>



<p class="code">σ, τ : ty ∷= ♭ | σ `→ τ</p>



<p>Our well-typed terms using de Bruijn indices are boring so we
will have a look at the definition of normal forms instead. By
definition, only stuck expressions (a variable followed by a spine
of arguments in normal form) of the base type can be regarded as
normal forms. The equational theory will accordingly include eta
rules.</p>



<p class="code">  data _⊢ne_ (Γ : Con ty) : ty → Set where
    `v   : (pr : σ ∈ Γ)                     → Γ ⊢ne σ
    _`$_ : (f : Γ ⊢ne σ `→ τ) (x : Γ ⊢nf σ) → Γ ⊢ne τ

  data _⊢nf_ (Γ : Con ty) : ty → Set where
    `↑_ : (t : Γ ⊢ne ♭)     → Γ ⊢nf ♭
    `λ_ : (b : Γ ∙ σ ⊢nf τ) → Γ ⊢nf σ `→ τ</p>



<p>All these notions obviously come with the expected weakening
operations.</p>



<a name="ModelDefinition-WhereTheGlueingHappens"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#ModelDefinition-WhereTheGlueingHappens">#</a> Model definition - where the glueing happens</h3>



<p>The model is defined in terms of reduction-free elements: the
interpretation of a term is either a neutral form which will just
grow when being eliminated or it is a normal form together with
an element of the <i>acting</i> model explaining what its behaviour
is.</p>



<p class="code">  _⊩_ : ∀ (Γ : Con ty) (σ : ty) → Set
  Γ ⊩ σ =   Γ ⊢ne σ
          ⊎ Γ ⊢nf σ × Γ ⊩⋆ σ</p>



<p>The acting model is the part of the model doing all the heavy
lifting when <i>computational</i> reductions are required. It has
a Kripke flavour in the sense that it refers to the full model in
any possible future context extension. Quite unsurprisingly, a
term of base type has no computational content (it can only be
a neutral) and elements of function type are interpreted as
functions on semantical objects.</p>



<p class="code">  _⊩⋆_ : ∀ (Γ : Con ty) (σ : ty) → Set
  Γ ⊩⋆ ♭      = ⊤
  Γ ⊩⋆ σ `→ τ = ∀ {Δ} (inc : Γ ⊆ Δ) → Δ ⊩ σ → Δ ⊩ τ</p>



<p>These definitions are easily extended to contexts by recursion
and give rise to semantical environments <span class="inline-code">Δ ⊩ε Γ</span>. A natural
notion of weakening can be made formal.</p>



<a name="The(notSo)TrivialQuotingFunction"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#The(notSo)TrivialQuotingFunction">#</a> The (not so) trivial quoting function</h3>



<p>Because of the way the model is defined, there is little to no
mystery that proving that each element has an image in the model
amounts to proving the existence of a procedure turning terms into
their cut-free equivalents.</p>



<p>Even if the definitions of quote and unquote are straightforward,
they are rather unusual: unlike their more traditional analogues, they
confine the uses of eta-expansion at reification time. This has to be
compared to the motto <i>eta-expansion both at the syntactical and
semantical level</i> usually associated with the (un)quote functions.
Additionally, this syntactic work is performed in a standalone
function <span class="inline-code">eta[_]_</span>
<a id="reftop3" href="#refbot3">[3]</a> which
is model agnostic.</p>



<p class="code">eta[_]_ : ∀ {Γ} σ (T : Γ ⊢ne σ) → Γ ⊢nf σ
eta[ ♭      ] t = `↑ t
eta[ σ `→ τ ] t = `λ eta[ τ ] (wk-ne inc t `$ var)
  where inc = step (same _)
        var = eta[ σ ] `v here!</p>



<p>This way of organizing extraction of normal forms from the model
brings us closer to a staged reduction process which deals
with computations (beta, delta, iota) first and then reorganizes
the cut-free forms using extra rules (eta, nu <a id="reftop4" href="#refbot4">[4]</a>) than your
average normalization by evaluation formalization.</p>



<a name="EvaluationFunction"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#EvaluationFunction">#</a> Evaluation function</h3>



<p>By combining weakening for semantical environments and unquote,
we can define a diagonal environment <span class="inline-code">Γ ⊩ε Γ</span> for every
<span class="inline-code">Γ</span>. In order to be able to extract normal forms from
simple terms, it is thus enough to define an evaluation function.</p>



<p class="code">eval : (t : Γ ⊢ σ) (ρ : Δ ⊩ε Γ) → Δ ⊩ σ</p>



<p><span class="inline-code">eval</span> is defined by induction on the structure of the term
<span class="inline-code">t</span>. In the variable case, a simple lookup in the semantical
environment produces the well-typed value needed. The application
case combines the induction hypotheses using <span class="inline-code">_$$_</span>, a
function defined by case analysis on the function: if the function
is stuck, the application also is whereas if it is live, the action
model will compute further using the argument.</p>



<p class="code">_$$_ : (F : Γ ⊩ σ `→ τ) (X : Γ ⊩ σ) → Γ ⊩ τ
inj₁ f       $$ X = inj₁ (f `$ ↑[ _ ] X)
inj₂ (f , F) $$ X = F (⊆-refl _) X</p>



<p>The lambda abstraction case is defined in two steps: first the
object <span class="inline-code">B</span> in the acting model can be generated by applying
the induction hypothesis for the body of the lambda in an extended
(and weakened) environment. And then the normal form is generated
by quoting the object obtained when applying <span class="inline-code">B</span> to the
variable bound by the head lambda.</p>


<p class="code">eval (`λ t) ρ = inj₂ (`λ ↑B , B)
  where B  : _ ⊩⋆ _ `→ _
        B  = λ inc X → eval t (wk-⊩ε _ inc ρ , X)
        ↑B = ↑[ _ ] B (step (⊆-refl _)) (↓[ _ ] `v here!)</p>



<p>Now we can just tie the knot and combine the diagonal environment
with the evaluation function and quote in order to obtain a
normalization procedure.</p>



<p class="code">norm[_]_ : ∀ {Γ} σ (t : Γ ⊢ σ) → Γ ⊢nf σ
norm[ σ ] t = ↑[ σ ] eval t (⊩ε-refl _)</p>



<a name="Conclusions"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#Conclusions">#</a> Conclusions</h3>



<p>We recalled that glueing can help us give more structure to our
models thus circumventing limitations of the naïve ones. But, more
importantly, we have also shown that this technique can produce new
insights on already well understood constructions by e.g. making it
possible to isolate different stages of the normalization process:
computation and standardization in our case.</p>
