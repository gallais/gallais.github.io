<p id="chapo">Phantom types are a well-known compile-time tool to ensure that
illegal actions (such as attempting to write in a read-only file) are
unrepresentable. In this blog post we introduce poltergeist types: phantom
types whose parameters may still knock around at runtime.</p>



<a name="ALightningIntroductionToPhantomTypes"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#ALightningIntroductionToPhantomTypes">#</a> A Lightning Introduction to Phantom Types</h3>



<p>
A phantom type is a parametrised type whose parameters do not show up in
the types of the (usually unique) constructor's arguments.
They can be used to document whether the arguments are respecting some
invariants. For instance the following definition declares a type of file
handles parametrised by two booleans corresponding to whether the file has
been opened with the ability to read and to write from it.</p>



<p>If we do not export the <span class="inline-code">MkHandle</span> constructor
then the only way for a user to manufacture a file handle is to use
the functions we provide. We can make sure that these functions enforce
that the parameters are always set to reflect the file handle's status.
</p>



<p class="code">data Handle : (read, write : Bool) -> Type where
  MkHandle : AnyPtr -> Path r w
</p>



<p>We can now make sure that we only attempt to get a line from a file we
are allowed to read from by insisting that the <span class="inline-code">read</span>
parameter of the handle we pass to <span class="inline-code">fGetLine</span> is
<span class="inline-code">True</span>.
Similarly we can restrict <span class="inline-code">fPutStr</span> to file handles
where we statically know that we are allowed to write.
</p>



<p class="code">fGetLine : Handle True write -> IO String
fPutStr  : Handle read True -> String -> IO ()
</p>



<p>
Note that in both cases we only restrict the parameter of interest, leaving
the other one as polymorphic as possible so that we may use
<span class="inline-code">fGetLine</span> with both read-only and read-write files.
If we need to we can enfore more constraints or no constraints whatsoever
e.g. reversing a file will require the ability to read and write to it but
closing a handle is completely agnostic with respect to the handle's
capabilities.
</p>



<p>The example we just saw is set in a dependently typed language but is not
specific to it. In OCaml for instance, we could define a largely similar
interface with the exception that the parameters of the
<span class="inline-code">Handle</span> phantom type would be types themselves and
not the boolean <i>values</i> we used.

Apart from this small change, the code would be largely the same and the runtime
behaviour virtually identical. In particular all of the parameters would be
erased at runtime
<a id="reftop1" href="#refbot1">[1]</a>.
</p>



<p>The dependently typed setting however allows us to ask whether we would
sometimes want the parameters' values to be available at runtime.

<p>
For this case study we want to devise a high level representation of a directory
tree. Up until now the only way to interact with the file system in Idris was to
use some very low-level primitives: <span class="inline-code">openDir</span> would take
a string and, provided that it represents a valid directory path, would return a
pointer representing the directory.
You could then repeatedly call <span class="inline-code">dirEntry</span> with that
pointer to get your hands on directory entries one by one. Once you were done
you would need to remember to call (exactly once!)
<span class="inline-code">closeDir</span> to free the pointer.
This leads to extremely imperative code with no separation of concerns:
in any function the exploration of the directory tree is intimately interleaved
with the function's own internal logic.
</p>



<p>
Our solution is to describe a directory tree as a record containing
a list of file names and
a list of directory names each paired with an <span class="inline-code">IO</span>
computation delivering the tree corresponding to the subdirectory. We can
provide a generic function building such a tree and then users can explore
it without having to bother with manipulating pointers.
The final decision is to pick how to represent these file names and directory
names.
We could use absolute paths but that would involve a lot of information
duplication as all the names in the tree share a common prefix.
We could alternatively use base names but that would force users
to reconstruct absolute paths when exploring the tree if they actually need
them which seems like an error-prone process.
Instead we opt for a phantom type: a <span class="inline-code">FileName</span> is
parametrised by its root but only stores the basename as a string.
</p>



<p class="code">data FileName : Path -> Type where
  MkFileName : String -> FileName root
</p>



<p>
And here is where we depart from classic phantom types: a user needing
access to the full file path can call <span class="inline-code">toFilePath</span>
on a <span class="inline-code">FileName root</span>
which will, provided that the <span class="inline-code">root</span> is runtime-relevant,
compute the appropriate answer.
</p>



<p class="code">toFilePath : {root : Path} -> FileName root -> String
toFilePath file = show (root /> file)
</p>



<p>
We can finally give the definition of a <span class="inline-code">Tree</span> we only
sketched earlier. A tree is a record anchored at a <span class="inline-code">root</span>
and it comprises a list of file names as well as a list of subtrees both of
which are anchored at that same root.
</p>



<p class="code">record Tree (root : Path) where
  constructor MkTree
  files    : List (FileName root)
  subTrees : List (SubTree root)
</p>



<p>
The key definition is that of the notion of subtrees. It is a dependent pair
storing a file name (the name of the directory) and an IO computation returning
a tree anchored at the parent's root extended with the name of the subdirectory.
This definition gives us the best of both worlds: the file names are only
storing the base names, but the user never has to explicitly reconstruct the
path when they explore a given tree. Indeed our definition guarantees
that the path is automatically extended when entering a subdirectory, and that
this extended path is used when calling <span class="inline-code">toFilePath</span>.
<p>

<p class="code">SubTree : Path -> Type
SubTree root = (dir : FileName root ** IO (Tree (root /> dir)))
</p>

</p>
When writing a function consuming a <span class="inline-code">Tree</span> we can leave
the parameter implicit (marking it erased or not depending on whether we
actually need this information at runtime)
and let Idris reconstruct the appropriate value by unification when performing
a recursive call.
We show below the type of two different traversals provided by the
<span class="inline-code">System.Directory.Tree</span> library:
<span class="inline-code">print</span> only uses base names to display the tree in the
console and as such its <span class="inline-code">root</span> argument is guaranteed to
be erased. The <span class="inline-code">findFile</span> function however looks for a
file whose basename matches a given string and returns a full path. As such it
needs to have access to the value of <span class="inline-code">root</span> and that is
why it is explicitly introduced with an unrestricted modality.
</p>



<p class="code">print    : Tree root -> IO ()
findFile : {root : Path} -> String -> Tree root -> IO (Maybe Path)
</p>



<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#Conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h3>



<p>
We have seens that instead of storing potentially useless information in a data
structure, or forcing users to carefully reconstruct it on the fly were they to
need it, we can instead parametrise our data structure over this information in
such a way that if it is needed then it will be automatically reconstructed by
the type system for us.

This gives us a new kind of types that are phantom in the sense that their
payloads are not influenced by their parameters but whose parameters may yet
manifest themselves physically at runtime. We call them poltergeists.

In Idris the variables in a type that are not explicitly bound are implicitly
universally quantified in a prenex position with quantity 0 i.e. they are
runtime-irrelevant.
In the type of <span class="inline-code">fGetLine</span> for instance, the boolean
variable <span class="inline-code">write</span> is therefore universally quantified,
and marked as erased.
The same thing applies to the variable <span class="inline-code">read</span> in the
type of <span class="inline-code">fPutStr</span>.
