<p id="chapo">Dimensional analysis is quite the tool to track down stupid
mistakes in physics much like a type-checker will detect non-sensical
expressions in your favourite statically-typed programming language.
I have been meaning to toy around with this notion in a dependently-typed
setting for quite a while. Here are a few definitions. As well as an
Agda program that needs to be <i>compiled</i>.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.bentnib.org">Bob</a> presented at
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/spls-2013-10/">SPLS</a>
a really cool
<a href="http://bentnib.org/posts/2013-07-17-one-done-two-submitted.html">
project</a> he has been working on: a type system which, by parametricity,
derives automagically <a id="reftop1" href="#refbot1">[1]</a> the premises of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem">Noether's
theorem</a>. All this talking about physics got me motivated enough to
spend Saturday's afternoon hacking up a toy example. This is probably not
revolutionary <a id="reftop2" href="#refbot2">[2]</a> but it was quite
amusing to develop anyway so here it is.</p>



<a name="TheDataStructuresInvolved"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#TheDataStructuresInvolved">#</a> The data structures involved</h3>



<p>This whole project is structured as a succession of modules in order to
to have separate name spaces. This way, we can make sure that the different
operations morally implementing the same concepts can have the same name.</p>



<a name="Dimensions"></a>
<h4><a class="sectionref" href="#Dimensions">#</a> Dimensions</h4>



<p>We will limit ourselves to 3 types of units of measure here: kilograms,
meters and seconds. The dimension of an object is modelled by a record storing
the exponents assigned to each one of these components.</p>



<p class="code">record dimension : Set where
  field
    kilogram : ℤ
    meter    : ℤ
    second   : ℤ</p>



<p>Taking the product of two dimensions amounts to summing the degrees for each
one of the units of measure. Quotienting is, likewise, a pointwise operation on
the two vectors: this time we compute the difference rather than the sum.</p>



<p class="code">_*_ : (d e : dimension) → dimension
d * e = record { kilogram = kilogram d + kilogram e
               ; meter    = meter d    + meter e
               ; second   = second d   + second e }</p>



<p>We can now define the basic dimensions: kilograms, meters and seconds by
assigning <span class="inline-code">+ 0</span> to all the fields except for the one of interest
which is instantiated with <span class="inline-code">+ 1</span>. As an example, here is the dimension
<span class="inline-code">sec</span> corresponding to seconds.</p>



<p class="code">sec = record { kilogram = + 0
             ; meter    = + 0
             ; second   = + 1 }</p>



<a name="UnitsOfMeasure"></a>
<h4><a class="sectionref" href="#UnitsOfMeasure">#</a> Units of measure</h4>



<p>So far, so good. But in real life we quite like to consider other units than
just the basic ones. A <span class="inline-code">unit</span> of measure is therefore a dimension
together with a non-zero coefficient. The type of <span class="inline-code">hn</span> has been chosen
so <span class="inline-code">hn</span> can be inferred by the system in concrete cases (if <span class="inline-code">n</span>
is non-zero, then <span class="inline-code">hn</span> is of type <span class="inline-code">⊤</span> hence equal to <span class="inline-code">tt</span>)
and to match the requirements imposed by <span class="inline-code">_div_</span> in the standard
library.</p>



<p class="code">data unit : Set where
  _,_#_ : (n : ℕ) (hn : False (n ℕ.≟ 0))
          (d : dimension) → unit</p>



<p>The product of two units is once more a pointwise operations: it is the
combination of the product of their coefficients (which is guaranteed to be
non-zero) and the product of their respective dimensions.</p>



<p class="code">_*_ : (u v : unit) → unit
(k , hk # d) * (l , hl # e) = k * l , _ # d * e</p>



<p>It is quite natural to introduce the SI's prefixes as functions altering a
previously defined unit. In our system, the types of <span class="inline-code">milli</span>,
<span class="inline-code">centi</span> and <span class="inline-code">deci</span> are nastier than the ones presented below
because we are using natural numbers rather than rational ones and division
of a non-zero number by a non-zero number can return zero.</p>



<p class="code">deca hecto kilo : unit → unit</p>



<p>A minute is nothing more than 60 seconds. 60 being different from 0 (!), the
proof obligation reduces to the only inhabitant of unit which is inferred by
the system:</p>



<p class="code">min : unit
min = 60 , _ # sec</p>



<a name="Values"></a>
<h4><a class="sectionref" href="#Values">#</a> Values</h4>



<p>Finally, values are just numerical values repackaged together with a unit.
We choose here to have a data constructor forcing the user to explicitly
mention the unit of measure to be attached to the value. It could be avoided
given that <span class="inline-code">d</span> is a parameter of the data-type but it is quite handy
for documentation purposes and on the fly definition of values.</p>



<p class="code">data \[_] : (d : unit) → Set where
  ⟨_∶_⟩ : (value : ℕ) (d : unit) → \\[ d ]</p>



<p>Multiplying to value has to return something of the right dimension but the
scaling factor can be arbitrary (we may multiply <span class="inline-code">kilo</span> meters by hours
and expect a result in <span class="inline-code">m / s</span>). Hence the following implementation.
Addition and division behave similarly.</p>



<p class="code">_*_ : \\[ k , hk #  d ] → \\[ l , hl # e ] →
      \\[ m , hm # d * e ]
_*_ ⟨ vd ∶ ._ ⟩ ⟨ ve ∶ ._ ⟩ =
    ⟨ (k * vd * l * ve) div m ∶ _ ⟩</p>



<p>Our implementation of value multiplication is so generic in its type that
it does not have the subformula property which will probably be problematic
in large expression where the type of all the subexpressions is not inferrable.
A simple solution is to specialize the return type down to
<span class="inline-code">\\[ 1 , _ # d * e ]</span> whilst introducing a lifting operation converting
from one type to an other.</p>



<p class="code">↑ : ∀ {k hk l hl d} → \[ k , hk # d ] → \[ l , hl # d ]
↑ ⟨ v ∶ ._ ⟩ = ⟨ (k * v) div l ∶ _ ⟩</p>



<a name="Examples"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#Examples">#</a> Examples</h3>



<p>This system tracking dimensions makes sure that we do not make mistakes
when combining different values but it also converts between various units.
For instance, the following expression normalizes to <span class="inline-code">10</span>.</p>



<p class="code">60hm/min : \[ deca m / s ]
60hm/min = ⟨ 60 ∶ hecto m ⟩ / ⟨ 1 ∶ min ⟩</p>



<a name="Application:SimulatingTheFreeFallOfABall"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#Application:SimulatingTheFreeFallOfABall">#</a> Application: simulating the free fall of a ball</h3>



<p>The setting of this simulation is pretty simple: we have a ball
characterized by its position, speed and acceleration in a vertical plan.
The gravitational constant <span class="inline-code">g</span> corresponding to earth's attraction
is expressed in <span class="inline-code">m / (s * s)</span> and equal to <span class="inline-code">10</span>.

<br />In order to simulate the free fall of this ball, we are going to apply
Newton's approximation method: time is discretized and the characterization
of the ball is updated at every single time-step. Here the type system
guarantees that we do not make mistakes.</p>



<p class="code">newton : ∀ (dt : \[ s ]) (p : point) → point
newton dt p =
  record { accx = accx p
         ; accy = accy p + g
         ; vx   = vx p   + (accx p :* dt)
         ; vy   = vy p   + (accy p :* dt)
         ; x    = x p    + (vx p   :* dt)
         ; y    = y p    + (vy p   :* dt) }</p>



<p>A simulation consists in applying repeatedly this newton transformation
to an initial point. We define the <span class="inline-code">throw</span> function doing exactly
this and generating a trace of all the successive positions.</p>



<p class="code">throw : (n : ℕ) (dt : \[ s ]) → point → Vec point (ℕ.suc n)
throw zero    dt p = p ∷ \[]
throw (suc n) dt p = p ∷ throw n dt (newton dt p)</p>



<p>After a little bit of magic, we are able to call a tracing function from
Haskell's <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gnuplot-0.5.1">Gnuplot</a>
wrapper and generate the following graph showing the (upside-down) ball's
trajectory in the vertical plan.</p>

<a name="Conclusions"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#Conclusions">#</a> Conclusions</h3>



<p>First of all, it works quite well for a first experiment! In a serious
implementation though, one should really use, at the very least, rational
numbers to represent the coefficients. This would ensure that conversion
ratios can be properly computed and make the work a lot more useful.
It is no coincidence that my example involving a speed expressed in
<i>distance per minutes</i> precisely picks a distance which is a multiple of
<span class="inline-code">60</span>... I haven't had the internet connection, the time nor the
desire to see whether appropriate libraries already exist for Agda or to
write my own ones.
<br />Similarly, the fact that the free fall is represented upside-down is a
direct consequence of the values not being integers but rather natural
numbers (once more due to a lack of libraries in Agda: <span class="inline-code">div</span> and
<span class="inline-code">mod</span> are only available for ℕ in the standard library).</p>



<p>And Agda's automatic case-splitting, support for Unicode, definition of
functions <i>via</i> equations, my (ridiculously small but good enough)
understanding of how to import Haskell function as postulates, etc. kept me
away from Coq (at least for the experimentation phase).</p>
