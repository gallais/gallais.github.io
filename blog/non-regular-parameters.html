<p id="chapo">Both Coq and Agda let the user declare datatypes with
non-regular parameters which do vary, are not quite indices and
can be large without bumping the universe level in which the
declaration lives. In his habilitation thesis, Bruno Barras
shows a nice trick explaining why these non-regular parameters
make sense.</p>




<a name="QuickDefinition"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#QuickDefinition">#</a> Quick definition</h3>



<p>A non-regular parameter for an inductive type is an (usually large) argument
of the <i>type</i> constructor which is used uniformly in the return type of its
<i>term</i> constructors (thus making it parameter-like) but may vary in their
recursive positions (making it index-like).</p>



<p>First of all, let's see a couple of use cases for non-regular parameters.

In Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson's
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fingertree">fingertrees</a>, the
non regular parameter « determines the unusual shape of these trees, which is
the key to their performance »
<a id="reftop1" href="#refbot1">[1]</a>. The non regularity is here used to enforce invariants
in the substructures by tightly controlling which constructors one may use.</p>



<p class="code">data FingerTree a = Empty
                  | Single a
                  | Deep (Digit a) (FingerTree (Node a)) (Digit a)
</p>



<p>Using <a href="?en/main/blog/read/lazy-lambda#section2">Type-level de Bruijn
indices</a> in order to bake in a syntax a notion of scope and binding sites
is another use of non regularity. In this case, the invariant we are enforcing
is the fact that one can only talk about variables which are in scope. But it
also formalizes lets us identify clearly the constructors which are binders.</p>



<p>Now that we have seen that this non-regularity can be useful, we would like
to know whether it is a safe feature. After all, having a system in which
<span class="inline-code">Type : Type</span> can simplify things quite a lot but it comes at the cost
of being inconsistent...</p>



<a name="TheEncoding"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#TheEncoding">#</a> The encoding</h3>



<p>We will not give a generic account of this transformation but explain
it by a simple example. Let's use the type-level de Bruijn indices case
to demonstrate how one can explain the use of a non-regular parameter in
terms of more basic concepts which are known to be sound. We will work in
Agda but it would be possible to perform the same construction in Coq as
demonstrated by <a href="code/NonRegularParameter/NonRegularParameter.v">this
file</a>.</p>



<a name="WhatOneWouldWriteInAgda"></a>
<h4><a class="sectionref" href="#WhatOneWouldWriteInAgda">#</a> What one would write in Agda</h4>



<p>We start by defining our simple lambda calculus <span class="inline-code">Lam</span> equipped
with a let binder. The parameter <span class="inline-code">A</span> represents the variables available
in scope; it needs therefore to be modified every time a binder introduces
fresh ones <a id="reftop2" href="#refbot2">[2]</a>:</p>



<p class="code">data Lam (A : Set) : Set where
  `var      : (a : A) → Lam A
  `app      : (t u : Lam A) → Lam A
  `lam      : (t : Lam (1 + A)) → Lam A
  `let_`in_ : {n : ℕ} (t : Vec (Lam A) n) (u : Lam (n + A)) → Lam A
</p>



<a name="ANaïveTranslationUsingLargeIndexes"></a>
<h4><a class="sectionref" href="#ANaïveTranslationUsingLargeIndexes">#</a> A naïve translation using large indexes</h4>



<p>Given that this argument varies in the various recursive positions,
one could consider calling it an index. This is where we run into troubles:
the value <span class="inline-code">A</span> used to be in context because it was treated like a
parameter; now that we consider it to be an index, every constructor has to
introduce <span class="inline-code">A</span> to be able to mention it. But <span class="inline-code">A</span> is large which
forces the datatype declaration to live one level up.</p>



<p class="code">data Lam : (A : Set) → Set₁ where
  `var      : {A : Set} (a : A) → Lam A
  `app      : {A : Set} (t u : Lam A) → Lam A
  `lam      : {A : Set} (t : Lam (1 + A)) → Lam A
  `let_`in_ : {A : Set} {n : ℕ} (t : Vec (Lam A) n) (u : Lam (n + A)) → Lam A</p>



<p>This is quite clearly not a satisfactory solution. It is, for instance, now
impossible to define the monadic <span class="inline-code">join</span> for <span class="inline-code">Lam</span> because
<span class="inline-code">Lam (Lam A)</span> is not even a type one can form! If we do need to introduce
an index to track down the modifications made to the non regular parameter then
it'd better be a small one. This is precisely what the encoding does.</p>



<a name="Barras'Encoding"></a>
<h4><a class="sectionref" href="#Barras'Encoding">#</a> Barras' encoding</h4>



<p>The important remark behind this encoding is that the shape of
the non-regular parameter at any point in a tree is entirely determined
by the value of the parameter at the root; the path followed from the root
down to this subtree and, potentially, additional information stored in
the nodes encountered along this path. Now, this information has to be small,
otherwise the inductive definition would not fit at its current level. It is
therefore sufficient to store, as a parameter, the value present at the root
and then use a <i>small</i> index to describe the path followed and the
information accumulated. In the case of our running example, the type of path
is as follows.</p>



<p class="code">data path : Set where
  `rt : path
  `bd : (n : ℕ) (p : path) → path</p>



<p><span class="inline-code">`rt</span> represents the root of the tree and <span class="inline-code">`bd</span> (for "binder")
represents both <span class="inline-code">`lam</span> and <span class="inline-code">`let_`in_</span> because we are only
interested in the number of variables introduced by a binding site. We note
that one can blithely forget about the <span class="inline-code">`app</span> constructors one crossed
because they do not alter the parameter. The <span class="inline-code">decode</span> function defining
the semantics of these paths is straightforward: the root induces the identity
and a binding site extends the environment with <span class="inline-code">n</span> new variables.</p>



<p class="code">decode : (p : path) (A : Set) → Set
decode `rt       A = A
decode (`bd n p) A = n + decode A p</p>



<p>This allows us to define a datatype in a theory with only parameters and
indices whilst keeping it small. As one would expect, it is possible to prove
that this inductive type is in bijection with the original one. The usual
problem arise with the termination checker when dealing with the nesting
<span class="inline-code">Vec (Lam A) n</span> but, as usual, inlining <span class="inline-code">Vec.map</span> is sufficient
to convince Agda that everything is fine.</p>



<p class="code">data Lam (A : Set) : path → Set where
  `var      : {p : path} (a : decode p A) → Lam A p
  `app      : {p : path} (t u : Lam A p) → Lam A p
  `lam      : {p : path} (t : Lam A (`bd 1 p)) → Lam A p
  `let_`in_ : {p : path} {n : ℕ} (t : Vec (Lam A p) n) (u : Lam A (`bd n p)) →
              Lam A p</p>



<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#Conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h3>



<p>Well that was fun! If you want a more general presentation, then have a look
at <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~barras/habilitation/">the thesis</a>
page 138 and following. Beware though: I started reading it because it was
mentioned somewhere that it explained how to make sense, in terms of indexed
families, of mutually defined inductive types leaving at different levels;
and stayed because I kept seeing other interesting topics. It's a trap.</p>
