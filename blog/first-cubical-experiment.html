<p id="chapo">
With Agda version 2.6.0 close to being released, I decided
to experiment with cubical Agda.
</p>



<p>
Now that <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/cubical.html">the
documentation for cubical Agda</a> is available, it should be easier to start
experimenting. I first tried to formalise Frumin, Geuvers, Gondelman, and van
der Weide's <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3167085">Finite Sets in
Homotopy Type Theory</a>. However I got stuck trying to write the very first
function when I had to figure out what a path's image was. Time to go back to
basics!
</p>



<a name="section0"></a>
<h2><a class="sectionref" href="#section0">#</a> A basic datatype: <tt>List⁰</tt></h2>



<p>
My attempt to boil down the problem I was facing resulted in <tt>List⁰</tt>.
It is a higher inductive type of strange lists: we have the two usual list
constructors, together with a path saying that a non-empty list is equal to
its tail.
</p>



<p class="code">data List⁰ (A : Set) : Set where
  []  : List⁰ A
  _∷_ : A → List⁰ A → List⁰ A
  del : ∀ x e → x ∷ e ≡ e
</p>



<p>
Hopefully, this mix of the familiar and the new will let us build on our
old intuitions to understand new concepts. We can start by revisiting a
function we know very well in the list case.
</p>



<a name="section1"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#section1">#</a> Appending two <tt>List⁰</tt></h3>



<p>
We define append by recursion on the first list. The first two cases
are similar to what one would do in Haskell (or vanilla Agda): if the first
list is empty, we return the second one; and if it has a head and a tail,
we cons the head and the result of the recursive call on the tail. But there
is also a third case: <tt>List⁰</tt> is a higher inductive type and that means
that we need to explain how append acts on paths!
</p>



<p class="code">_++_ : (e f : List⁰ A) → List⁰ A
[]        ++ f = f
(x ∷ e)   ++ f = x ∷ (e ++ f)
del x e i ++ f = ?
</p>



<p>
Because the function <tt>_++_</tt> acts on elements of <tt>List⁰ A</tt>,
we need its first argument to be of type <tt>List⁰ A</tt>. For this reason,
the case mentions <span class="inline-code">del x e i</span>: a value at position <tt>i</tt>
along the line of type <span class="inline-code">x ∷ e ≡ e</span> described by <tt>del</tt>.
The type of the hole is <tt>List⁰ A</tt> but it does not mean that we can put just
about any expression in: there are side conditions!
</p>



<p>
These sides conditions can be understood from a very practical point of view:
if <tt>i</tt> gets instantiated to either <tt>i0</tt> or <tt>i1</tt>, the value
of <span class="inline-code">del x e i ++ f</span> should not depend on whether we
evaluate <tt>_++_</tt> first and then instantiate <tt>i</tt>, or the converse.
To guarantee that evaluation is confluent, Agda demands that both reductions
lead to judgmentally equal values.
</p>



<p>
Understanding where these constraints come from, we can compute them. Remembering
that if <tt>p</tt> has type <span class="inline-code">a ≡ b</span> then <span class="inline-code">p i0 = a</span>
and <span class="inline-code">p i1 = b</span>:
</p>



<p class="code">i = i0 ⊢ del x e i ++ f    { del x e i0 = x ∷ e }
       = x ∷ e     ++ f    { unfold _++_ }
       = x ∷ (e ++ f)

i = i1 ⊢ del x e i ++ f    { del x e i1 = e }
       = e ++ f
</p>



<p>
So, the expression we pick to fill in the <tt>List⁰ A</tt> will need to be
equal to <span class="inline-code">x ∷ (e ++ f)</span> if <tt>i</tt> is <tt>i0</tt>
and <span class="inline-code">e ++ f</span> if <tt>i</tt> is <tt>i1</tt>.
Observing that <span class="inline-code">del x (e ++ f)</span> has type
<span class="inline-code">x ∷ (e ++ f) ≡ e ++ f</span>, we pick the following
solution:
</p>



<p class="code">del x e i ++ f = del x (e ++ f) i
</p>



<p>
Agda performs the checks we have mentioned earlier and sees that our
solution is indeed compatible with the equations we already had. We
now have a fully-defined function. Time to prove some of its properties!
</p>



<a name="ProvingThePropertiesOfAppend"></a>
<h2><a class="sectionref" href="#ProvingThePropertiesOfAppend">#</a> Proving the Properties of Append</h2>



<p>
Just like for lists, we can prove that <span class="inline-code">[]</span> is a neutral
element for the binary operation <span class="inline-code">_++_</span>. That is to say
that both <span class="inline-code">[] ++_</span> and <span class="inline-code">_++ []</span>
are the identity function. This should not be too much work but it will get us
the opportunity to think about what happens in the <span class="inline-code">del</span>
case. We will then prove a more complex result: given that <span class="inline-code">del</span>
allows us to peel-off the head of a non-empty list, we should be able to prove
that we can ``cancel'' append, that is to say that <span class="inline-code">e ++ f</span>
is equal to <span class="inline-code">f</span>.
</p>



<a name="LeftAndRightIdentities"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#LeftAndRightIdentities">#</a> Left and Right Identities</h3>



<p>
The left identity holds by computation: the definition of append itself declares
that <span class="inline-code">[] ++ e</span> should reduce to <span class="inline-code">e</span>.
We can use <span class="inline-code">refl</span> to prove the goal like we would do in
vanilla Agda. The main difference here being that <span class="inline-code">refl</span> is
not a constructor: it is the constant function which given any value in the interval
returns <span class="inline-code">e</span>.
</p>



<p class="code">++-idˡ : (e : List⁰ A) → [] ++ e ≡ e
++-idˡ e = refl
</p>



<p>
The right identity requires a bit more work: given that append is defined by
recursion on its first argument, we need to proceed by induction on it. The first
two cases are what you would expect from the proof of
<a href="https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/v0.17/Data.List.Properties.html#4357">
a similar result on lists</a>.
</p>



<p class="code">++-idʳ : (e : List⁰ A) → e ++ [] ≡ e
++-idʳ []          = refl
++-idʳ (x ∷ e)     = cong (x ∷_) (++-idʳ e)
++-idʳ (del x e i) = ?
</p>



<p>
The last case is not a lot more complicated, at least at first glance:
<ul><li>the left hand side of the equality goal is <span class="inline-code">del x e i ++ []</span>
which reduces to <span class="inline-code">del x (e ++ []) i</span> by definition of
append</li>
<li>the right hand side is <span class="inline-code">del x e i</span></li></ul>
A natural candidate for this equality is to use the induction hypothesis to
obtain a proof that <span class="inline-code">e ++ [] ≡ e</span> and use congruence
to apply the function <span class="inline-code">λ e → del x e i</span> to each side.
However remember that we need to check that this definition is compatible with
the other clauses when <tt>i</tt> becomes either <tt>i0</tt> or <tt>i1</tt>.
This gives us the following constraints:
</p>



<p class="code">i = i0 ⊢ ++-idʳ (del x e i)       { del x e i0 = x ∷ e }
       = ++-idʳ (x ∷ e)           { unfold ++-idʳ }
       = cong (x ∷_) (++-idʳ e)

i = i1 ⊢ ++-idʳ (del x e i)       { del x e i1 = e }
       = ++-idʳ e
</p>



<p>
We can easily verify that <span class="inline-code">cong (λ e → del x e i) (++-idʳ e)</span>
does collapse to the right expressions when we set <tt>i</tt> to either <tt>i0</tt> or
<tt>i1</tt> thanks in part to the fact that <span class="inline-code">cong (λ x → x) p</span>
is definitionally equal to <span class="inline-code">p</span>. This leads us to the following
completed definition:
</p>



<p class="code">++-idʳ : (e : List⁰ A) → e ++ [] ≡ e
++-idʳ []          = refl
++-idʳ (x ∷ e)     = cong (x ∷_) (++-idʳ e)
++-idʳ (del x e i) = cong (λ e → del x e i) (++-idʳ e)
</p>



<p>We can now move on to a more difficult proof.</p>



<a name="CancellingAppend"></a>
<h3><a class="sectionref" href="#CancellingAppend">#</a> Cancelling append</h3>



<p>
Given that a non-empty list is declared equal to its tail it should be possible
to prove that if we append two lists, the result is equal to the second one alone.
The intuition being that we can repeatedly use <span class="inline-code">del</span> to
consume all of the elements in the first list. Formally, this gives us the type:
</p>



<p class="code">dels : (e f : List⁰ A) → e ++ f ≡ f
</p>



<p>Remarking once more that append is defined by recursion on its first argument,
we proceed by induction on it. The first case is easily dealt with: it is precisely
the left identity law for append which we know holds definitionally. For uniformity
with the upcoming case, we eta-expand <span class="inline-code">refl</span> and write <a id="reftop1" href="#refbot1">[1]</a>:
</p>



<p class="code">dels [] f j = f
</p>



<p>The second clause demands an equality proof between
<span class="inline-code">x ∷ e ++ f</span> on the one hand and
<span class="inline-code">f</span> on the other. We could use
transitivity to combine a call to <span class="inline-code">del</span>
taking us from <span class="inline-code">x ∷ e ++ f</span> to
<span class="inline-code">e ++ f</span> and then use the induction
hypothesis to conclude. However it turns out that we can
find a more compact proof by defining the path explicitly.
We write:
</p>



<p class="code">dels (x ∷ e) f j = del x (dels e f j) j
</p>



<p>
We let the reader check that when <tt>j</tt> is <tt>i0</tt> we
do get <span class="inline-code">x ∷ e ++ f</span> whilst making <tt>j</tt>
equal to <tt>i1</tt> takes us to <span class="inline-code">f</span>.
We are now left with the last clause. We need a term of type
<span class="inline-code">del x e i ++ f ≡ f</span> which satisfies the
usual two side conditions stating that when we make <tt>i</tt>
either <tt>i0</tt> or <tt>i1</tt>, it is compatible with the previous
clauses.
</p>



<p class="code">i = i0 ⊢ dels (del x e i) f j       { del x e i0 = x ∷ e }
       = dels (x ∷ e) f j           { unfold dels }
       = del x (dels e f j) j

i = i1 ⊢ dels (del x e i) f j       { del x e i1 = e }
       = dels e f j
</p>



<p>It is hard to give an intuition for the jump from these constraints
to the solution. One thing we can notice is that <span class="inline-code">dels e f j</span>
is the right hand side of the equality proved by <span class="inline-code">del x (dels e f j)</span>.
So we need to somehow get a term which is equal <span class="inline-code">del x (dels e f j) j</span>
when <tt>i</tt> is <tt>i0</tt> and collapses to <span class="inline-code">del x (dels e f j)</span>'s
right hand side when <tt>i</tt> is <tt>i1</tt>.</p>



<p>
The key idea in cubical Agda which will help us here is the fact that
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/cubical.html#the-interval-and-path-types">
elements of the interval form a De Morgan algebra</a>. We can use the interval
value <span class="inline-code">i ∨ j</span>: when <tt>i</tt> is <tt>i0</tt>, we get <tt>j</tt>
back and when <tt>i</tt> is <tt>i1</tt>, <span class="inline-code">i ∨ j</span> collapses to <tt>i1</tt>.
</p>



<p>
The reader can check that <span class="inline-code">λ j → del x (dels e f j) (i ∨ j)</span>
proves the equality <span class="inline-code">del x e i ++ f ≡ f</span> and that it reduces
to the right expressions when <tt>i</tt> is set to either of the interval's extremities.
Putting everything together, we get the following definition:
</p>



<p class="code">dels : (e f : List⁰ A) → e ++ f ≡ f
dels []          f j = f
dels (x ∷ e)     f j = del x (dels e f j) j
dels (del x e i) f j = del x (dels e f j) (i ∨ j)
</p>

<h2><a class="sectionref" href="#Conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h2>



<p>
It took me about ten hours total to formalise the content of this post, most
of it spent on <span class="inline-code">dels</span>. Once I understood the origin of
the side conditions one has to deal with in the cases involving
<span class="inline-code">del x e i</span>, it finally clicked and things felt easier.
I hope this post makes the confluence imperative behind these side conditions
clear and really drills down the importance of computing them.
</p>



<p>I would like to conclude this post by thanking
<a href="http://cs.ru.nl/~nweide/">Nils van der Weide</a> and
<a href="https://cs.ru.nl/~dfrumin/">Dan Frumin</a> for sharing my misery when
banging my head against these simple-looking problems as well as the insightful
discussions that ensued.
