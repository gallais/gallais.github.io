<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>I am currently preparing a PhD thesis on dependently typed programming under
<a href="http://strictlypositive.org">Conor McBride</a>'s supervision among the
<a href="http://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/">MSP</a> group at the
<a href="http://cis.strath.ac.uk">University of Strathclyde</a> (Glasgow -
Scotland).</p>

<h3>Research interests</h3>

<p>I am decidedly a type theory enthusiast. Most of my research nowadays revolves
around leveraging a type system to enforce invariants, help writing code correct
by construction or prevent the user from abusing the interface offered to her.
I am passionate about building normalization procedures by exploiting various model
construction techniques, developping certified proof search algorithms or constructing
universes internalizing desirable properties. My languages of choice are
<a href="https://github.com/agda/agda" title="Agda">Agda</a>,
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/" title="Haskell">Haskell</a> and
<a href="http://ocaml.org/" title="OCaml">OCaml</a>.</p>

<p>In the past, I have done my fair share of work in <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a>
(formalizing a good chunk of real analysis dealing with power series) and
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/">Isabelle</a> (certifying the
output of automated termination tools).</p>
